## Package Descriptions
 - **.bashrc:** is a shell script file that executes every time a new Bash session is initiated/user logs onto the system's terminal. Is used to set up the user's shell environment according to their preferences by allowing them to define aliases, functions, environment variables, and executing commands within the .bashrc file.
 - **Alias:** is a user-defined shortcut for a longer command or sequence of commands. Instructs the shell to replace one string with another string while executing the commands.
 - **Symbolic Link:** is a file that stores a path to an existing file or directory on any local or external volume.
