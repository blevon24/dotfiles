## How to create aliases
There are two methods to create aliases, which are listed below. I used the first method on this assignment.

 1. Edit `.bashrc` file directly
     1. `cd ~/.bashrc` to change directories to the `.bashrc` file, then use the vim command `vim .bashrc` to open the file for editing
